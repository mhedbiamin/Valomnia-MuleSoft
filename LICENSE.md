If a payment is not made by the date specified in an invoice, VALOMNIA shall formally notify the CLIENT by e-­‐mail or post.

Notwithstanding VALOMNIA’ other rights, in particular termination, VALOMNIA reserves the right to demand payment of daily late payment interest in the event of total or partial non-­‐payment of an invoice when due, without any formalities. This interest will be equal to the rate applied by the European Central Bank in effect on the date the payment is due. In such event, late payment interest shall begin on the date following the invoice due date and shall run up to and including the date on which the CLIENT pays the due amount to VALOMNIA in full. Said interest shall continue to accrue on the amounts due notwithstanding termination of the agreement for any reason whatsoever.

Total or partial non-­‐payment of invoices shall result ipso jure in all invoices that have been issued becoming due and payable. Accordingly, all invoices shall be immediately due and payable from the date of preparation until they have been paid in full.

If invoices are not paid when due, any collection costs shall be borne by the CLIENT, which agrees to pay them. Late payment shall result in addition to the next invoice of a minimum charge of forty euros (40€) for each reminder or registered letter sent.

If the amounts remain unpaid, the agreement will be terminated within the period specified in the formal reminder letter, without any further notice being required.
